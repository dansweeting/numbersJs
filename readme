Demonstration of javascript automated testing with the jasmine framework.

In this demo, by using phantomJs at the command line, it's possible to automate your tests without the need for a browser - or you can manually run tests in a browser by loading spec/SpecRunner.html 

See the simple run-tests.sh script for example.
